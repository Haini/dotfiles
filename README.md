# dotfiles

The start of a dotfile collection. Since I often have to switch machine (ssh on different ones etc.) I finally
got annoyed by recreating (and ofc forgetting some stuff while recreating) my .rc files (mainly vim). 

#Usage:
```
git clone git://github.com/Haini/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
chmod +x makesymlinks.sh
./makesymlinks.sh
```

Thanks to the internet and in special to https://github.com/michaeljsmalley 's repo where I did learn how to organize dotfiles.
